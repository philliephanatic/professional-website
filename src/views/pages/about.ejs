                        My career spans media, technology, and regulated industries, but the throughline has always been
                        the same: building and optimizing digital experiences that perform at scale. I work at the
                        intersection of strategy, data, and execution—ensuring websites function as growth platforms,
                        not cost centers.

                        Today, I focus on technical site operations and experimentation for high-traffic digital
                        properties, driving measurable gains in conversion, discoverability, and revenue across global
                        audiences. My work spans CMS ownership, experimentation platforms, and analytics-driven funnel
                        analysis to prioritize and scale meaningful improvements.

                    <span>
                        Earlier in my career, I supported international expansion initiatives, managed large-scale
                        landing page ecosystems, and delivered compliant, high-performing web experiences within
                        complex, regulated environments.

                        I gravitate toward work where technical fluency, disciplined experimentation, and measurable
                        business outcomes intersect—creating systems that scale cleanly and deliver long-term value.
