                        My career spans media, technology, and regulated industries, but the throughline has always
                        been
                        the same: building and optimizing digital experiences that perform at scale. I work at the
                        intersection of strategy, data, and execution, partnering closely with content, analytics,
                        engineering, and marketing teams to ensure websites function as growth platforms—not cost
                        centers.

                        Today, I lead technical site operations and experimentation for high-traffic digital
                        properties,
                        combining hands-on execution with data-driven strategy to improve conversion,
                        discoverability,
                        and revenue impact across global audiences. My work includes operating directly within CMS
                        and
                        experimentation platforms, collaborating with analytics teams, and using SQL-based insights
                        to
                        identify funnel gaps and prioritize optimization efforts.

                        Earlier in my career, I supported international expansion initiatives, managed large-scale
                        landing page ecosystems, and delivered compliant, high-performing web experiences in
                        complex,
                        regulated environments.

                        I’m most drawn to roles where technical fluency, disciplined experimentation, and measurable
